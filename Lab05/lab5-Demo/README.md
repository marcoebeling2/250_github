## Lab Question Answers

Answer for Question 1: 

dBm is a unit of measurement for the strength of the signal. It takes in a value in mW and converts it to a log scale via:
dBm = 10 * log10(mW)

Answer for Question 2:
The different OS have different methods used to get signal strength. They return different values and formats, so we need to have specifics regex for each.

Answer for Question 3:
it runs a shell command and retrieves the output of that command.

Answer for Question 4:
it is matching a regex for the output of the previously run shell command.

Answer for Question 5:
signal quality is a percentage of maximal strength, which is -100 dbm, so we need to conver it.

Answer for Question 6:
standard deviation is the measure of variance that an average sample has from the mean. This can show the stability of the wifi signal.

Answer for Question 7: 
a dataframe is basically the python version of an excel spreadsheet. It stores data in a 2D tabular format. It is useful because there are easy built in function to index and manipulate the data in whatever way you want.

Answer for Question 8:
error bars are important because they give us key insight into the variance of the data we collected. Plotting this shows the stability of the singal.

Answer for Question 9:
as I got further away, the signal got weaker and less stable. The best wifi is in my bedroom and living room!
