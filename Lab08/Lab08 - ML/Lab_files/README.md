Answer to Question 1:
Green: Cent/Penny
Blue: Nickel
Orange: Dollar
The coins will show variation because sometime the metal gets chipped or the manufacturing is not perfect. If our machine had a weight sensor, we would use it to determine of the coin. Then we would apply a one sample t test to determine the likelihood of the coin belonging to each denomination.

Answer to Question 2:
The light sensor can do this.

Answer to Question 3:
Sets A, C, and D are seperable. This is because a single line could seperate the two denominations with 100% accuracy.

Answer to Question 4:
Liner combinations of higher order polynomials, hyperbolas, circle, intersecting lines, and elipses can be used to draw boundaries.

Answer to Question 5:
input of the sigmoid function = -2 + [2,1,2].T dot [1, -2, 3] = -2 + 6 = 4
sigmoid(4) = 1/ 1 + exp(-4) = 0.982
