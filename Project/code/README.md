1. Bind Uvicorn to all interfaces

In your start command, make sure you listen on 0.0.0.0 (not just 127.0.0.1):

uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

That makes your app visible on your machine’s LAN IP.
2. Open your firewall

On Windows:

    Search “Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.”

    Add an Inbound Rule allowing TCP port 8000.

On macOS or Linux, use whatever firewall tool you have (ufw, iptables, pf, etc.) to allow inbound on that port.
3. Configure your router (NAT / port forwarding)

Most home networks sit behind a NAT router. You need to:

    Log into your router’s admin page (usually at 192.168.1.1 or 10.0.0.1).

    Find Port Forwarding or Virtual Servers.

    Forward external TCP port 80 (or 8000, or 443 if you’ll do HTTPS) to your machine’s local IP on the same port.

        e.g. External 80 → 192.168.1.42:8000

    Save and reboot the rule if needed.

4. Get a public address

    Direct IP: Your ISP will assign you a public IP (check by googling “what’s my IP”). You can share http://<that-ip>:80/stats_view with people.

    Dynamic DNS: If your IP changes, use a free DDNS service (No-IP, DuckDNS, Dynu) to tie a hostname (e.g. myapp.duckdns.org) to your home IP. Their client updates the IP whenever it moves.

5. (Optional but strongly recommended) HTTPS

Browsers will warn or block insecure APIs on port 80/8000. To get TLS:

    Install Certbot on your machine (if you forwarded 80 → 8000 you’ll need to temporarily run an HTTP server on port 80 for validation).

    Run certbot certonly --standalone -d your-ddns-name to fetch a Let’s Encrypt cert.

    Use a small reverse proxy like Caddy or Nginx to terminate TLS on port 443 and proxy to Uvicorn:

    server {
      listen 443 ssl;
      server_name your-ddns-name;

      ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-ddns-name/fullchain.pem;
      ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-ddns-name/privkey.pem;

      location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      }
    }

    This gives you https://your-ddns-name/stats_view with a valid lock icon.

6. Caveats & security

    Keep your machine on (and Uvicorn running).

    Watch your bandwidth—home connections often have low upload speeds.

    Lock down your endpoints—if this is sensitive data, add authentication.

    Monitor logs—you’re exposing a service to the open Internet now.

Quick alternative for dev/testing: Ngrok

If you just want to share for a few minutes, install ngrok:

ngrok http 8000

Ngrok will give you a public https://abcdef.ngrok.io that tunnels straight to your local Uvicorn—no router or firewall tinkering required. It’s free for short-lived tunnels and super‐handy for demos.

With those steps, your FastAPI app running on your personal computer will be accessible by anyone on the Internet.
